# 🧪 Prompt Style Guide for GPT-4  
**By [Your Name] – 2025**

A modular guide for designing clear, brand-aligned prompts using GPT-4, with a focus on editorial writing and customer support tasks.

## 🔧 1. Purpose

This guide standardizes the structure, tone, and formatting of prompts used with GPT-4 to generate high-quality, consistent content.

It is designed for:
- Editorial and support content generation
- Prompt evaluation and iteration
- LLM-assisted content workflows

## ✍️ 2. Prompt Design Principles

- **Clarity first**: Be explicit with instructions.
- **Be modular**: Use reusable prompt components.
- **Control tone and verbosity**: Always define voice, tone, and response length.
- **Test & iterate**: Use a rubric to guide refinements.

## 🧱 3. Prompt Template Examples

### 🔹 A. Editorial Summarization (Concise & Neutral)

**Prompt:**  
> Summarize the following article in 2–3 sentences. Use a neutral, professional tone and focus only on the main ideas.  
>  
> [Insert article text]

### 🔹 B. Customer Support (Friendly & Empathetic)

**Prompt:**  
> Respond to the following customer issue in a friendly and empathetic tone. Acknowledge the frustration, offer a solution, and provide next steps.  
>  
> Customer: "I’ve been charged twice for my subscription, and I can’t reach anyone to fix it."

### 🔹 C. Tone Transformation (Formal → Casual)

**Prompt:**  
> Rewrite the following paragraph in a casual, conversational tone suitable for a blog post.  
>  
> [Insert formal text]

## 🎨 4. Tone & Style Guidelines

| Attribute   | Guideline |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Tone**    | Explicitly specify: e.g. friendly, professional, empathetic |
| **Format**  | Bullet points for clarity; paragraphs for summaries |
| **Voice**   | Use second-person ("you") for direct content unless specified otherwise |
| **Length**  | Use prompts like: "Respond in 2–3 sentences" or "Provide 3–5 paragraphs" |

## 🧪 5. Prompt Variations & Controls

### Verbosity control  
> "Respond in 1–2 sentences."  
> vs.  
> "Provide a detailed response in 3–5 paragraphs."

### Format control  
> "Use bullet points for key points."  
> vs.  
> "Write as a continuous paragraph."

## 📊 6. Evaluation Rubric

| Criterion          | 1 – Poor | 2 – Fair | 3 – Good | 4 – Excellent |
|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Fluency**        | Grammatical issues or awkward phrasing | Mostly clear | Natural, readable | Effortlessly fluent |
| **Tone Alignment** | Off-tone or inconsistent | Slight mismatch | Generally aligned | Perfectly matches tone |
| **Factuality**     | Inaccurate or misleading | Some vague claims | Mostly accurate | Fully accurate |
| **Structure**      | Disorganized | Some structure | Clear flow | Highly polished & logical |

## 🚫 7. Common Failure Patterns

- Too verbose or too brief relative to the request  
- Tone mismatches (e.g., robotic or overly casual)  
- Ignored format instructions (e.g., bullets vs. paragraphs)  
- Generalized or vague responses lacking detail  

## 🔄 8. Prompt Iteration Log (Example)

| Version | Notes | Next Steps |
|---------|-------|------------|
| V1      | Too robotic | Add tone guidance |
| V2      | Tone improved, but long | Add word limit |
| V3      | Clear, concise, friendly | Finalized |

## ✅ 9. Key Takeaways

- Prompt structure directly impacts content tone and usability.  
- Small adjustments (tone, length, format) make big differences.  
- Reusable templates + evaluation rubrics = scalable editorial workflows.
